During a number of sessions during the [2014 API-Craft Conference][], it became apparent that a group of
like-minded developers were grappling with similar design patterns and architectures in the Hypermedia
tooling they were creating. A conversation ensued discussing these similarities centered around a brain-dead
simple, state-machine interface for introspecting, interacting with and generating diverse Hypermedia messages:

Given that each were working in different programming languages, it was proposed to join together to
refine a common architecture and interface and then implement developer-friendly tooling in their respective
languages.

The Hypermedia Project was formed to leverage each others expertise to develop tooling for our own
cross-platform Hypermedia applications and to help lower the barrier to entry for interested developers
to explore and create their own Hypermedia APIs in simple, yet powerful ways.
